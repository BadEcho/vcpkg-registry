This repo acts as a registry that manages C/C++ packages used by Bad Echo projects. These are mainly third party prorgams; none of their code is hosted in this repo, rather this registry merely links to them and provides a means to acquire them during build processes.

## About Bad Echo
Bad Echo is a collection of software technologies and [various writings](https://badecho.com) by Matt Weber: a software designer, partnered [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/omni) streamer, and game developer.

While Bad Echo code concerns itself a great deal with the "best approaches" to general software problems, it also focuses on game development and providing entertainment through the clever manipulation of games (the results of which are streamed by myself).

## Getting in Contact
I'm a partnered Twitch streamer, and talking to me during one of my [Omnified streams](https://twitch.tv/omni), on the off chance that I actually _am_ streaming, is most definitely the quickest way to get my attention!

You may also reach me [via email](mailto:matt@badecho.com).
